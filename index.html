        <h2>Technology Advancement</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="parag">
            <p class="parag">Technology is evolving rapidly that we couldn't
                imagine how is negative and positive impact it has given us.
                Artificial intelligence, geotargeting, automation, and other
                advancements in information technology specifically set the phase
                for more technological evolution. Robotics are becoming smarter,
                personal homes are getting techy with gadgets and appliances and
                even our thermostats and refrigerators can be connected to the
                internet.</p>
            <p class="parag">Modern society has progressed in many ways to
                relay data and information across the globe in a matter of seconds,
                revolutionizing the practice and means of communications from human
                to human. Progressing from manual writing and sending letters
                through post to electronic mail and texting via smartphones. The
                famous World Wide Web being used to transform an industry of
                communications into a phase even unheard of from our technology
                forefathers.</p>
            <p class="parag">Advancements have led us to researches and
                discoveries we've never imagined possible with the push of a button
                or a voice recognition as well as making daily life just so much
                easier and better. The need for writing letters and sending parcels
                that waiting weeks or even months to receive them or having to
                travel and visit places across the world has been cut into a tool
                that literally defines the new technological generation. The
                internet has not only become the medium of how most people reach
                and connect one another but the medium of how most people do,
                process and learn anything nowadays. The evolution of technology
                has tremendously altered the entire world into a day and age where
                anything we could possibly desire is at the tip of our
                fingertips.</p>

   <p>According to <a class="site-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, Artificial intelligence (AI) is
                intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural
                intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has
                been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which
                refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes
                actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.</p>
            <p>The term "<i>artificial intelligence</i>" had previously been
                used to describe machines that mimic and display "human" cognitive
                skills that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning"
                and "problem-solving". This definition has since been rejected by
                major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality
                and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be
                articulated.</p>
            <p>AI broadly refers to applications of technology that perform
                tasks resembling human cognitive function where machines are
                capable to imitate intelligent human behavior. AI is a wide-ranging
                branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines
                capable of performing tasks that typically require human
                intelligence. It is the simulation or approximation of human
                intelligence processes by machines especially computer systems. The
                machines are programmed to think like humans and mimic their
                actions and behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence Technology</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) arrived in 1950s,
                which a computer scientist <a class="site-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)" target="_blank">John McCarthy</a> coined the term Artificial
                Intelligence. <strong>AI</strong> have been gaining popularity
                since then as technology advances rapidly, and it continues its
                function in present generation and even the future. Almost every
                area of the government, business and professional sectors in our
                developing society have been integrating artificial intelligence
                technology.</p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence application is applied into the fields
                like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Business</li>

    <!--COPIED LAYOUT STYLE FROM THE INTRODUCTION-->
    <div class="intro">
        <div class="parag">
            <p class="parag">AI applications include advanced web search
                engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube,
                Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and
                Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making
                and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such
                as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks
                considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the
                definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For
                instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from
                things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in
                1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of
                optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known
                as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed
                funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different
                approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain,
                modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of
                knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of
                the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning
                has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly
                successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout
                industry and academia.</p>
            <p>The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around
                particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional
                goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation,
                planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and
                the ability to move and manipulate objects.[c] General intelligence
                (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's
                long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have
                adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving
                techniques—including search and mathematical optimization, formal
                logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics,
                probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science,
                psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.</p>

                <p>With all the hypes and popularity of AI, there have been always
                    a debate about the pros and cons that it contribute. Artificial
                    Intelligence is one of the emerging technologies which tries to
                    simulate human reasoning in AI systems. The advantages of
                    Artificial intelligence applications are enormous and can
                    revolutionize any professional sector.</p>
                <p>With the simulation of human intelligence, processes by machines
                    that are especially computer systems include learning the
                    acquisition of information and rules for using it. This is indeed a
                    great challenge for human intelligence to apply into machines.</p>
                <p>While the impact of advances of the AI technology is undeniably
                    beneficial, let's discuss some of the major advantages and
                    disadvantages of artificial Intelligence that we could have.</p>

            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li class="list"><i>Automation</i></li>
                <p>Automation is one of the important advantages of AI. It
                    describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human
                    intervention in processes. Human intervention is reduced by
                    predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and
                    related actions, and embodying those predeterminations in
                    machines.</p>
                <li><i>Advancement in Medical Applications</i></li>
                <p>One of the sophisticated advancement of Artificial Intelligence
                    that have caused a major impact in the modern society is the
                    medical or healthcare systems and applications. Intelligent
                    machines are really of great importance in research, diagnostic and
                    treatment of diseases. These advance technologies allow healthcare
                    professionals to treat and save people they never could have
                    treated and saved before.</p>
                <li><i>Human-Error Reduction</i></li>
                <p>Since Artificial Intelligence is programmed in machines or
                    embedded in systems following some sets of algorithms, error could
                    be avoidable. Human has the tendency to forget, neglect or ignore
                    some task. Machines on the other hand could increase accuracy and
                    precision.</p>
                <li><i>Availability</i></li>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence system is available 24/7, no excuses,
                    unless there is an absence of some necessary resources like an
                    electricity or an internet connection for a longer period of
                    time.</p>
                <li><i>Faster Decision Making</i></li>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence has always been used for making smarter
                    business decisions. It can coordinate data delivery, analyze
                    trends, develop data consistency, provide forecasts, and quantify
                    uncertainties to make the best decisions for the company.</p>
                <li><i>Accuracy and Precision</i></li>
                <p>Since Artificial Intelligence is programmed using an algorithm,
                    it is accurate and fast. These processes are used specially in big
                    production companies that produce tons of products in a short
                    period of time.</p>
                <li><i>Repetitive Jobs Made Easy</i></li>
                <p>Human can get tired and exhausted. Machines do not. Artificial
                    Intelligence can carry on repetitive jobs gracefully with no
                    complains.</p>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Production High Costs</i></li>
                <p>Machines and tools with Artificial Intelligence are very costly
                    in production, thus requires high budget to acquire those machines
                    or systems.</p>
                <li><i>Turns Human Lazy</i></li>
                <p>The reliance to Artificial Intelligence will eventually turn the
                    human lazy. Machines and tools can operate with very less or even
                    no human intervention needed.</p>
                <li><i>Unemployment Increase</i></li>
                <p>This is one of the major drawbacks of Artificial Intelligence.
                    Because most businesses especially those in the big production
                    companies are acquiring those intelligent machines for their
                    production resources, thus leaving many people unemployed. This is
                    highly detrimental in our society since increase of unemployment
                    causes social problems.</p>
                <li><i>Ethical Issues</i></li>
                <p>Machines and tools with Artificial Inteligence is as much as
                    intelligent as humans but they do not possess high intellect as
                    humans. Thus the use of artificial Intelligence causes an ethical
                    issues in some areas among various sectors, especially in
                    Healthcare.</p>
                <li><i>No Initiatives</i></li>
                <p>Machines simply designed to act according to the program they
                    are capable of doing. They cannot do the things needed to do in
                    case of any untoward situations. Unlike humans, who can perform and
                    think out of the box, can provide logical and ethical solutions
                    according to what circumstances may ask.</p>
